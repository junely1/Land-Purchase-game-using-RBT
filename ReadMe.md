This is a program to manage the members about land transaction in a game of a game company. 
In order to efficiently manage all the members, I used Red black tree. 

This program consists of 7 fundamental functions regarding the queries after acquiring the input list: 
- add new member, 
- search a particular memberâ€™s information, 
- recharge balance of a member, 
- rank the top 5 biggest balance amount out of all the members, 
- keep track of recent modifications and print out them of a member, 
- land purchasing transactions, 
- quit the program.
